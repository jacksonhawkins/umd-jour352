            <p> Undergraduate student at the University of Maryland in College Park where I learned a variety of knowledge. More specifically, I was a member of the Merrill College of Journalism where I majored in Multi-Platform Journalism.

The diversity of classes provided a well balanced and versatile journalism learning experience. With this, I also took a 12 credit minor in the Music and Culture department at the UMD School of Music. I learned large portions of musicology and knowledge on percussion ensembles. </p>
