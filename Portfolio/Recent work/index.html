                <p> I got started at WMUC Radio in the spring semester of the 2023 school year. Someone in the UMD NPPA
                    chapter recommended that I at least apply or give it a try because they knew I enjoyed talking about
                    music but did not have an outlet that was “right for me” yet. I am sure glad I went out on a limb to
                    apply as I got an interview and landed a show after going through multiple shadow sessions with
                    current DJ’s and a board test, where I was quizzed by the programming director in the studio around
                    the broadcast equipment. After that, I started a show on March 31st from 1-2PM on Fridays. I have
                    done 18 shows including that one, but shifted my show time for this semester to 12-1PM on Fridays. I
                    play a variety of music, but the theme around the show is Vibey music, it encompasses a wide array
                    of music whether that be through lyrics or production.
                    This semester being my second at the station, I had the pleasure of being welcomed back easily and
                    have even stepped up to help with New DJ Training, allowing them to shadow my shows when needed. I
                    am also currently involved with the record team each week where we work on organizing the Station’s
                    ridiculously large collection of Vinyl, which is very much needed with over 1000 records in there. I
                    also was recently welcomed to the Press Committee where I will be able to write up concert reviews
                    or write-ups for free on WMUC’s dime when approved.

                <p> With me having 18 shows under my belt now, I have a pretty good grasp on the type of music I play on
                    the show; whether it be a normal mix of songs I enjoy or a specific theme for the week’s show. A
                    show will usually include 15-17 songs, having a runtime of 52-55 minutes of music to make sure I
                    have ample time to talk about the songs while not being short on music at the same time.
                    A normal show mix will most likely include around 10 rap songs, 2-3 of other genres whether that be
                    R&B or Soul songs, and then around 2-3 instrumental songs to end the show. The themed shows are
                    usually around a specific vibe, artists spotlight, or niche situation. In terms of Niche situations,
                    for example this past week I did a theme called “Nighttime Drives but At Noon Instead,” where I
                    played a wide variety of songs that I would play on a nighttime drive. Some themes I have done in
                    the past have included: Self Encouragement, Fully instrumental, a full Alchemist – Rap Producer –
                    centered show, a full Navy Blue – rapper and producer– show, and a show with my girlfriend and I’s
                    joint music taste.
                    Some more themes I hope to incorporate into my show include: DMV songs (DC MARYLAND VIRGINIA), Grimy
                    Fall Day, another Alchemist show, Dirty South, and even a guitar riff playlist.

        <h2> Future Goals at the Station </h2>
        <p> With three semesters left at the University of Maryland, I know my time is limited which is why I want to
            make the most of it. I recently just got inducted into the Press Committee at WMUC which I had to apply for.
            This is a big accomplishment for me because it centers around concert and artist spotlight writing, which is
            what I am very passionate about in the written journalism business. I plan to make this a big part of my
            life because A: I enjoy concerts and music and B: I enjoy writing about things I am passionate about; not as
            much news writing. At the station, I also want to take a bigger role with the record team as I would enjoy
            being the record library manager and would not mind being on the WMUC executive board.
            In terms of my show, I plan to continue the same pattern for shows and maybe even want to incorporate more
            guests or even artists to come on the show for interviews.
