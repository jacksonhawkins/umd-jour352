        <p> My name is Jackson Hawkins, a 23-year-old senior at the University of Maryland  majoring in Multi-Platform Journalism and minoring in Music and Culture. I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and have always wanted to study journalism. Growing up a Maryland sports fan, I always had UMD as my dream school. As I have progressed through college, I have found a passion for writing about music and constantly keeping up with the latest drops/developments in the music industry. I love a wide array of music but my real passion is within Hip-Hop/Rap and more specifically, Underground Rap. After college, I hope to get a job in something related to the music industry, but for now I am a radio host on WMUC Digital; the local radio station at my University. The show I host is on Fridays from 12pm-1pm is called "Music for the Vibers," and is a true testament of the type of music I play. </p>

           <h2> My Four Top Songs of the Week </h2> 
        <p class="song"> 1: plz don't cut my wings  
                    <p>This song is off of underground rapper MIKE's new album titled “Burning Desire.” The track features Earl Sweatshirt, another underground legend himself who has extensive history of collaboration with MIKE. This song is one that is incredibly laid back with beautiful production with a violin loop being played along with an 808 beat knock. The hook is very catchy with the words and melody itself. Earl provides a nice feature verse on it towards the end of the track and complements the beat very well.
                    <br> <i> Favorite Lyric:</i> “How could you save ‘em dog? You guided me on the wrong path”
                         </p> 
        <p class="song"> 2: Phoenix  
                    <p> Phoenix is a new stand-alone single from British rapper Lord Apex featuring Freddie Gibbs, a rapper from Gary Indiana. The highlight on this song is an incredibly beautiful and hypnotizing beat from Argov, with a great vocal loop which is complemented by both rapper’s good flow. The hook is one that could stick in your head all day. Apex does a great job on this track and Gibbs gives one of his best feature verses in recent history.
                    <br> <i> Favorite Lyric:</i> “Only space that is relatively safe is my own mind, I wouldn’t have my freedom if I wasn't on my own grind.”
                         </p>  
        <p class="song"> 3: KITCHEN LIGHTS 
                     <p> KITCHEN LIGHTS is a new song from Westside Gunn, a Buffalo based rapper who just dropped his new and “final” studio album called “And Then You Pray For Me.” While I am not high on this whole album, this is a stellar track that features incredible production from DJ Benoit and a great feature from frequent Collaborator of Westside, Stove God Cooks. The beginning verse from Westside is one of his best on the album, but the catchiness of the hook is the highlight of the track. Stove God follows up his wonderful singing on the hook with one of his best verses in recent memory.
                    <br> <i> Favorite Lyric:</i> “The ones prayin that I fall the ones that say they love me (that’s how it goes).” 
                         </p> 
        <p class="song"> 4: ROSE STREET   
                 <p> ROSE STREET is a song off of Vince Staples’ 2022 album, “Ramona Park Broke my Heart.” This was the second of two singles off of his album and it was one of my favorite tracks of last year that is back in my rotation. The track is super upbeat with a laid back, not in your face flow from Vince. It is incredibly catchy, especially the hook, mainly talking about relationship problems with his girl. Highly recommended and highly recommend the whole album.
                    <br>
                <i> Favorite Lyric:</i> “Can’t press rewind, life is like the movies baby.”
