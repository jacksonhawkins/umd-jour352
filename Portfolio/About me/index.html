            <h2> Background </h2>
            <p> My name is Jackson Hawkins, a senior journalism student at the University of Maryland. I grew up in
                Silver Spring, Maryland to two lovely parents who fostered my growth greatly. Growing up twenty minutes
                from UMD always made me want to go there, but the basketball team was always one that brought me true
                love for UMD. After graduating high school, I decided to go to UMD in pursuit of Sports Journalism. I
                had a rocky first few years which had me in and out of community college; which I am eternally grateful
                for. While my love was originally for sports broadcasting, during the pandemic my main love and passion
                shifted to music. I fell in love with rap music, specifically artists like Freddie Gibbs, Isaiah Rashad,
                Navy Blue, and Boldy James. I harnessed this love during the pandemic into listening to as many albums
                and new artists as I could, leading me to create a whole twitter just to talk music plus build a
                community I could talk with. In addition to listening to a lot more music, I started collecting records
                to which I have ~125 records at the moment. My real love is discussing music with whoever wants to,
                which also led me to becoming a host of my own show on WMUC-Digital College Park; an hour a week where I
                could play music I was already going to play, just for others as well. </p>
            <h2> Goals and Aspirations </h2>
            <p> Someone once said the future is limitless, which is how I feel at the moment. I do not have any direct
                aspirations at the moment for a perfect job, or my dream job. I just know that I want my job to be in
                the music industry, where I feel I could help a lot of people and artists along the way. While I have
                enjoyed learning about journalism and practicing it, I feel as if there are others who should consider
                that path; but not me. I would not mind working in PR or marketing for a music firm, or working social
                media for an artist on their team. I still have a lot to figure out in the next three semesters but that
                all comes with time; something I have been lucky enough to afford. I plan to continue to host a radio
                show on WMUC as long as I can, so check out Music for the Vibers on WMUC Digital College Park every
                Friday from 12-1pm. </p>
