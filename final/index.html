                <p> In the week after the overdose death of Pittsburgh-born rapper, producer and songwriter Mac Miller in 2018, streams of his music catalog grew 970% and his 2018 album “Swimming” made its way to #1 on the Billboard Top 100 albums. Now five years later, his popularity remains consistent. </p>
                <p> Beginning his career in 2007 as “Easy Mac,” he started releasing mixtapes as a kid for fun and started picking up popularity due to releasing music videos on a new video sharing platform known as Youtube. In his 11-year career, Miller released a total of 23 musical projects: 13 mixtapes, six studio albums, two live albums and two extended plays.

                <p> Like life, artists die and when they do, their music tends to garner more attention and streams due to the news of their death. Fans of artists and people who were not familiar tend to latch onto songs from that artist and play it in the weeks after the news.
                    There have been numerous cases of artists getting more streams post-death such as XXXTentacion, Pop Smoke, JuiceWrld, Prince and Takeoff from the rap group Migos. 
                    Mac Miller is no different.His death marked a moment of sustained success and popularity after he was gone.</p>

                <p>Mac Miller’s estate has promised not to release any new albums from Miller as they believe it would be a disservice to what he would want. While this is the case, they have found ways to keep Miller’s name in the spotlight with the approval of some feature verses, playlist placements and in the biggest way: re-releasing some of his off-streaming mixtapes onto streaming services.

                <h2> The Bottom Line </h2>
                <p> While people die and the music lasts forever, it often cannot take back the pain that family and fans of Miller felt when he passed away. The music can ease the pain and help mask it, but his estate and fans should rest easy knowing that Miller’s numbers will continue to stay high and that more people will find and appreciate Mac Miller every day. 
                    Rest in Peace Mac Miller; <b> the most dope.</b>
