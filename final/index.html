            <p> Mac Miller was a rapper, producer and songwriter from Pittsburgh before his untimely passing on
                September 7, 2018. According to the autopsy, Miller died due to an accidental overdose of alcohol,
                fentanyl and cocaine at the age of 26. Revered by his fans, his music skyrocketed in popularity after
                his death. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p> In his 11 year career, Miller released a total of 23 musical projects: 13 mixtapes, six studio albums,
                two live albums and two extended plays. Beginning his career in 2007 as “Easy Mac,” he started releasing
                mixtapes as a kid for fun and started picking up popularity due to releasing music videos on a new video
                sharing platform known as Youtube.

    <h2> The Sad Reality </h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p> Like life, artists die and when they do, their music tends to obtain more attention and streams due to
                the news of their death. Fans of artists and people who were not familiar tend to latch onto songs from
                that artist and play it in the coming weeks of the news, bringing up their popularity at the time around
                death.
                There have been numerous cases of artists getting more streams post-death announcement such as
                XXXTentacion, Pop Smoke, JuiceWrld, Prince and even Takeoff from the rap group Migos. Mac Miller is no
                different besides that his death marked a moment of sustained success and popularity.

            <p> According to Billboard and Nielsen music, in the week following Miller’s death, his streams grew 970%
                and his 2018 album “Swimming” made its way to #1 on the Billboard Top 100 albums. In the single month
                spanning from the end of Aug. 2018 to the end of Sept. 2018, according to Chart Metric, he gained around
                6.5 million monthly
                listeners; this is likely associated with his death announcement. </p>

            <p> After his death, his numbers never plateaued or took a nosedive, but rather a steady increase in monthly
                listeners. Miller increased his total Spotify monthly listeners by 1.76 million from Dec. 2018 to Dec.
                2019. </p>

    <h2> Circles and Mac's 2020 Success </h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p> In Jan. 2020, Miller’s estate, along with producer Jon Brion, decided to release his only posthumous
                album, “Circles”. A week before "Circles” was released, Miller’s estate dropped the first and only
                single for the album in “Good News.” According to Chart Metric, “Good News” along with the “Circles’'
                release helped earn Miller nearly 11 million more monthly listeners in the span of one month. <br> The
                week he died in 2018, his monthly listenership increased to a little over 14 million listeners. After
                the Circles release, he continued this trajectory of success by not falling below 13 million listeners
                to present day. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p> Mac Miller’s estate promised to not release any new albums from Miller as they believe it would be a
                disservice to what he would want. While this is the case, they have found ways to keep Miller’s name in
                the spotlight with the approval of some feature verses, playlist placements and in the biggest way;
                re-releasing some of his off-streaming mixtapes onto streaming services. </p>

                in the
                spotlight. Even dating and eventually breaking up with Grande did not apply the increase in

                Miller felt when he passed away. The music can ease the pain and help mask it, but his estate
                and fans
                should rest easy knowing that Miller’s numbers will continue to stay high and that more people
                will find
                and appreciate Mac Miller every day. Rest in Peace Mac Miller; <b> The Most Dope. </b> </p>
